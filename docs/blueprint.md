## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep indigo (#4B0082) to evoke feelings of intellect, depth, and importance. It also contrasts with the lighter elements to subtly enhance focus on key elements.
- Background color: Dark charcoal gray (#333333) to provide a high contrast dark mode appearance, reducing eye strain and improving focus, a common UX technique used to improve the stickiness of an app.
- Accent color: Electric purple (#BF00FF) to highlight interactive elements and call-to-action buttons. Its unconventional placement can captivate viewers.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' sans-serif. Body font: 'Inter' sans-serif. The futuristic and clean aspects improve aesthetics, thus eliciting emotions which align with trust. The body uses a more ubiquitous design.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying technical information such as that contained in job descriptions.
- Use sharp, vector-based icons in a monochromatic style with the accent color to guide users intuitively. Use subtle sizing differences of commonly known icons (such as arrows and links) in unconventional ways that guide user decision making without being noticeable.
- Maintain a structured layout with clear sections for job descriptions and candidate profiles, emphasizing essential details using visual hierarchy. Employ asymmetrical layout of less critical content, since asymmetrical composition are considered as dynamic and appealing, enhancing viewers' cognitive processing fluency.
- Incorporate smooth transitions and loading animations. An example includes highlighting successful search term completions, thus inducing emotional responses to engage potential end users.
